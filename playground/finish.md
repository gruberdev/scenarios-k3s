This playground will always have the latest stable K3s version a few weeks after release.


You have access to an empty K3s cluster with a 4GB node. The controlplane node has taint removed to be able to schedule workload as well.


This is just an empty environment, if you're looking for scenarios check

or all [Areas](https://killercoda.com/areas).
